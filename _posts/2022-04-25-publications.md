I was so happy to publish my master's thesis paper on ENASE 2022 with my supervisors Hourieh Khalajzadeh, Humphrey O. Obie, Jennifer Mcintosh and my fellow Kwangsu Choi.
This is one of the most interesting projects I joined in SenseTime that advances Smart Entertainment Solution For Riyadh Season, Brings A Safe, Immersive, and Enjoyable Guest Experience.
