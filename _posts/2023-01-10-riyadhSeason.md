Riyadh Season is the biggest cultural and entertainment program in Saudi Arabia, which builds on the Saudi Vision 2030 goal of establishing the entertainment industry as a key component of the national economy. This year’s Riyadh Season was held from 20 October 2021 to March 2022 under the slogan #Imagine_More, offering unprecedented opportunities for locals, residents, and visitors to enjoy world-class entertainment and activities across 14 themed zones all over the city.
